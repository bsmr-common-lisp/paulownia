* Codename: Paulownia
StumpWM's codebase while stable is showing its age.  Furthermore there
have been recent developments in the common lisp ecosystem that
stumpwm has been insulated from.  

This is an attempt to modernize the stumpwm codebase while fixing some
of stumpwm's Achilles heels. 
** Design Goals
- Test driven design. Unit tests that matter (using [[https://github.com/fukamachi/prove][prove]])
- Re-use as much code from stumpwm as possible
- Support for non-ascii input
- Utilize existing libraries rather than re-implementing subsets of
  existing functionality
